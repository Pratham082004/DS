💡 **Recommendations:**
- Consider feature scaling or normalization for better model stability.
- Try dimensionality reduction (PCA) if dataset has many features.
- Evaluate advanced models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost).
- Apply cross-validation for more reliable performance.
- Tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV or Optuna.
- Check feature importance to remove low-impact columns.
